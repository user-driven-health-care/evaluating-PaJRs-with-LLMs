Such inhibition prevents the degradation of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). This results in improved glycaemic control as determined by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, and, in addition, an enhancement of pancreatic α- and β-cell function.[14/09/23, 4:50:01 PM] Medha 2k19: Therapeutic EfficacyIn well designed monotherapy trials of 24–108 weeks’ duration (n = 131–786), vildagliptin provided effective glycaemic control as assessed by the change from baseline in HbA1c and FPG levels relative to placebo. Vildagliptin was as effective as acarbose and rosiglitazone, but not metformin, in terms of lowering HbA1c when noninferiority criteria were met. A pooled analysis of data from five monotherapy trials (n = 1138) further confirmed that vildagliptin provided effective glycaemic control after 24 weeks of treatment.In combination therapy trials of 24 weeks’ duration in patients with type 2 diabetes for whom hyperglycaemia was inadequately controlled with prior metformin monotherapy, vildagliptin used as an adjunct to metformin provided better glycaemic control than placebo plus metformin (n = 416) and was as effective as pioglitazone plus metformin (n = 510) in improving glycaemic control in a noninferiority trial.In other combination therapy studies also of 24 weeks’ duration (n = 296–408), vildagliptin was more effective than placebo as add-on therapy to insulin, glimepiride or pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by monotherapy despite receiving maximum effective doses[14/09/23, 4:51:33 PM] Rakesh Biswas Sir Hod Med: Tell us more detail about the glucose numbers in the vildagliptin and placebo group and metformin group[14/09/23, 4:53:03 PM] Medha 2k19: Sir, it seems that the images weren’t taken. But, they asked for a review with full bladder, so we can get pictures then[14/09/23, 6:32:37 PM] Medha 2k19: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6323540_Comparison_between_vildagliptin_and_metformin_to_sustain_reductions_in_HbA_1c_over_1year_in_drug-nave_patients_with_Type2_diabetes[14/09/23, 6:34:26 PM] Medha 2k19: “At the study end, significant HbA(1c) reductions from baseline were seen with both vildagliptin (-1.0 +/- 0.1%, P < 0.001) and metformin (-1.4 +/- 0.1%, P < 0.001); however, statistical non-inferiority of 50 mg vildagliptin twice daily to 1000 mg metformin twice daily was not established”[14/09/23, 6:34:45 PM] Medha 2k19: “A clinically meaningful decrease in HbA(1c) that was sustained throughout a 1-year treatment in drug-naïve patients with Type 2 DM was seen with both metformin and vildagliptin monotherapy.”[14/09/23, 6:35:50 PM] Medha 2k19: “The incidence of hypoglycaemia was similarly low in both groups (< 1%).”CASE 4 :- PaJR grp https://chat.whatsapp.com/GQcbsMAV3m4Lvwh03eVKBdBlog :- https://nikhilsaikarnatirollno69.blogspot.com/2023/09/a-71-year-old-male-with-complaints-of.htmlA 71 year old male with complaints of loss of consciousness 30 mins back .

An erect abdomen was done which showed some dilated loops but were not significant for any obstruction.And was started conservatively.Then patient was investigated with amylase and lipase levels which were found to be raised ( 104 IU/L ) but the levels of lipase were normal and in the suspicion of pancreatitis CT was advised and it showed IMPRESSION:- ACUTE EDEMATOUS INTERSTITIAL PANCREATITIS CONFINED TO THE HEAD AND UNCINATE PROCESS	⁃	  NO CALCIFICATIONS	⁃	  MILD ASCITES	⁃	  NO VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS	⁃	  MILD RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION	⁃	  MODIFIED CT ST SCORE 4/10.But then was transferred to the Gen medicine for the further management of pancreatitis.THE PATIENT WAS GIVEN SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT AND  WAS NBM FOR 3 DAYS AND THEN STARTED ON A SOFT DIET. And now PATIENT HAS NO COMPLAINT OF THE PAIN ABDOMEN.THE PATIENT IS HEMODYNAMICALLY STABLE AND ADVISED FOR DISCHARGE.WHEN THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED THE BISAP SCORE WAS AROUND 2 WHICH MEANS THE MORTALITY WAS AROUND 3.6 PERCENT AND AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE THE BISAP SCORE IS 0 WHICH MEANS THE MORTALITY IS 0.1 PERCENT.On the day of admission, abdominal girth was around 84 cm, and now at the time of discharge 70 cm ( that means the distension is also resolved)And PATIENT WAS ADVISED TO# stop alcohol. # Take plenty of water[26/08/23, 8:34:40 AM] Nikhilsai Karnati: PROBLEM THAT LEAD TO PRESENT ILLNESS:- The patient is an occasional alcoholic drink with his peers (functions, parties:- 90-180ml).But from 3 before the illness, the patient started drinking (binge drinking) (whiskey).So the cause may be chronic consumption of alcohol and present binge drinking from past 3 days before illness.[26/08/23, 8:37:29 AM] Rakesh Biswas Sir Hod Med: Process the information in the case report and list the known and unknown learning points (questions) as per the guidelines here👇https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2023/08/project-illustration-of-how-to-process.html?m=0CASE 7:- PAJR :- 60F swelling of left lower  limb 5days, Diabetes 10 years Telangana PaJR. [15/08/23, 9:03:46 AM] Nikhilsai Karnati: 14/08/2023Ward :  wardUnit : 2DOA : 9/8/23Dr LOHITH PG Y1 Dr NARSIMHA PG 2YDr ZAIN SRS:Altered sensorium improved ; patient is conscious but not oriented to time place and person ; stool passed O: SUPERFICIAL BURNS OVER LEFT THIGH WITH ULCER OVER LEFT MEDIAL MALLEOLUS WITH GRAFE II BED SORE OVER LEFT GLUTEAL REGION ANo icterus,cyanosis,clubbing,lymphadenopathyBp-140/70mmHgPr-  88bpmTemperature - 99.9 FRr- 18cpmSpo2- 96 % on RACVS-S1,S2 heard ,no murmursRS- BAE present NVBS CNS-NO FNDPupils- B/L NSRLP/A- Soft, NTL/A-Dressing intact,edema decreased ,minimal Slough present ,granulation tissue present P:1.RT FEEDS 2 SCOOPS OF PROTEIN POWDER 4TH HRLY2.IV FLUIDS NS @75 ML/HR3.INJ PAN 40 MG IV OD4.INJ LASIx 40 MG IV BD5.INJ HAI SC TID.6.TAB NODOSIS 1 GM /RT /TID7.TAB DOLO 650 MG RT SOS8.TAB CHYMEROL FORTE PO TID9.TAB MVT PO OD10.TAB VIT C PO OD11.OINTMENT MUPIROCIN FOR LA12.LEFT LOWER LIMB ELEVATION13.ACTIVE AMBULATION14.DRESSING15.

However, there is little evidence on patient-level benign outcomes to support the practice.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy and safety of oral sodium bicarbonate in CKD patients. A total of 1853 patients with chronic metabolic acidosis or those with low-normal serum bicarbonate (22–24 mEq/L) were performed to compare the efficacy and safety of oral sodium bicarbonate in patients with CKD.ResultsThere was a significant increase in serum bicarbonate level (MD 2.37 mEq/L; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.72) and slowed the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (MD −4.44 mL/min per 1.73 m2, 95% CI, −4.92 to −3.96) compared with the control groups. The sodium bicarbonate lowered T50-time, an indicator of vascular calcification (MD −20.74 min; 95% CI, −49.55 to 8.08); however, there was no significant difference between the two groups. In addition, oral sodium bicarbonate dramatically reduced systolic blood pressure (MD −2.97 mmHg; 95% CI, −5.04 to −0.90) and diastolic blood pressure (MD −1.26 mmHg; 95% CI, −2.33 to −0.19). There were no statistically significant body weight, urine pH and mean mid-arm muscle circumference.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8665881/[15/08/23, 11:26:27 AM] Nikhilsai Karnati: Efficacy of NODOSIS Sir[15/08/23, 11:26:43 AM] Nikhilsai Karnati: Trypsin:Chymotrypsin in Accidental, Surgical, and Orthopedic Injuries—Clinical Appraisal Goel and Sengupta [15] studied the efficacy of trypsin:chymotrypsin (Chymoral) in accidental soft tissue injuries. They included 156 patients (age between 14 and 45 years) presenting in the casualty department with bruises, lacerations, hematomas, and sprains and strains. The patients were randomized into two groups: the Chymoral group (n = 79), which received trypsin:chymotrypsin therapy along with standard emergency treatment, and the control group (n = 77), which received emergency treatment only. The recommended dosage of Chymoral was employed, i.e., 2 tablets 4 times a day × 7 days, 30 min before a meal. The patients were followed either once weekly or twice weekly and their progress was documented. Trypsin:chymotrypsin use resolves bruises within 8–12 days, which otherwise cleared in 10–15 days. In patients with lacerations, it improved the appearance of scarring due to stitches. Also, hematomas of the forehead and knees, which usually take 2–3 weeks to clear, resolved within 10–12 days in the Chymoral group. Ankle sprains normally take 2–3 weeks to recover. However, speedy recovery was documented with trypsin:chymotrypsin use, clearing as quickly as within 7–12 days. Additional benefits associated with the use of the enzyme preparation included relief in pain and lower incidence of infection. It was concluded that trypsin:chymotrypsin treatment in patients with accidental soft tissue injuries hastens the healing process and significantly reduces the recovery time. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5778189/[15/08/23, 11:29:04 AM] Nikhilsai Karnati: Sir ,therefore  it is concluded that chymotrypsin ( chymoral forte) treatment is significantly better tolerated and more effective than other enzyme preparations in resolving symptoms of inflammation and therefore promotes better healing.[15/08/23, 1:16:32 PM] Rakesh Biswas Sir Hod Med: Share some of the RCTs from this review one by one in a PICO format to understand how the individual studies are much smaller than the summative systematic review that possibly pools apples and oranges. Even if you look at the numbers that you shared you will realize they are not at all clinically significant inspite of the author's rhetoric![15/08/23, 1:38:11 PM] Nikhilsai Karnati: oral bicarbonate( nodosis)  is widely used to correct acidosis in advanced CKD, this is not underpinned by any trial evidence, real uncertainty exists regarding the balance of benefit and risk for this intervention. As most patients with CKD are old, and many are frail, it is critical that trials testing such interventions enrol typical patients and use outcome measures that are relevant to older people. Few older people with even advanced CKD will progress to end-stage renal disease; the risk of death from cardiovascular disease or infection often supervenes long before the need for renal replacement therapy. The range of outcomes selected for this trial will allow an estimation of overall net benefit or harm across a range of disease outcomes including renal, bone and vascular disease, as well as focusing on outcomes that are important to patients (function and quality of life) and policymakers (cost-utility analysis).https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4522127/[15/08/23, 1:39:32 PM] Nikhilsai Karnati: Many trails are being performed and are still awaited sir but it is not proved or supported by any trail as such.[15/08/23, 1:43:07 PM] Nikhilsai Karnati: Sodium Bicarbonate is an alkalizer. It works by increasing the pH of blood and urine, thereby correcting metabolic acidosis (high acid levels in the body). It also speeds up the removal of toxic substances from the body in certain types of poisoning.Sir, As it is an  alkalizer which increases the pH it is used widely in correction of acidosis but no trail based proof is  published as of now to support use of nodosis.[15/08/23, 1:46:48 PM] Rakesh Biswas Sir Hod Med: How was the randomization done here? Were the study participants including the evaluators blinded? Doesn't appear so. Again how clinically significant is an advantage of two day earlier healing? How did they decide the healing time? Good find. Now answer the above questions. Are you an exam going intern or exam gone intern?[15/08/23, 1:48:04 PM] Rakesh Biswas Sir Hod Med: Dont worry about that. Just discuss one RCT to understand why there is no evidence[15/08/23, 1:49:26 PM] Nikhilsai Karnati: 2018 intern posted in unit 3 from today sir[15/08/23, 2:03:16 PM] Nikhilsai Karnati: No sir ,the Evaluators are not blinded I guess . so there may be selection bias at the end of the trail to pick it up 2 days earlier but even though the only clinical significance of this early recovery for the patient is “ he will be out of pain 2 days earlier “ which will be the main complaint of many patients . And mostly they would have decided the recovery time by assessing the pain of the patient and decreased incidence of infections at the site there after …They randomly divided the patient grp in to the chymoral forte grp and non chymoral grp . There is no criteria used to divide them .[15/08/23, 2:07:44 PM] Nikhilsai Karnati: The main limitation of the above analysis is the lack of long-term follow-ups of oral sodium bicarbonate on patient-centered endpoints, including mortality.There was significant clinical heterogeneity of the included trials, such as sodium bicarbonate dose, control strategy, baseline eGFR and serum bicarbonate levels, and treatment duration, so it was difficult to obtain an exact conclusion.So due to the above limitations till date there may not be a proper evidence for nodosis.[15/08/23, 2:22:20 PM] Rakesh Biswas Sir Hod Med: The second para appears to be your opinion or assumption going by your choice of words? Instead of saying: mostly they would have...why not check what they have actually done?[15/08/23, 2:39:09 PM] Rakesh Biswas Sir Hod Med: Please quote the relevant portions instead of screen shooting them as it's more difficult to archive screen shots.One of the things we tried to emphasize in the 2017 internship completion online portfolio assessments is the intern logging his her work daily in a manner to leave regular online traces to their work, which can be verified with the date of logging. For example you can put all the above discussion around the current evidence for this particular patient's treatment into her case report that will automatically also show the date and time of your logged inputs. If we need to evaluate your performance at a later date during internship completion extension decision making, you would have sufficiently logged evidence of your work on this date. Pĺease share this with other 2018 interns and please ask them to seek any clarifications in the main group @919604701505 I guess often it's more about the users adapting to existing tech rather than anything else. Presence of audit trails in google blogspot where are current dynamic EHRs are housed would surely be a big value add![15/08/23, 2:40:08 PM] Rakesh Biswas Sir Hod Med: Most of their conclusions appear very subjective![15/08/23, 2:46:41 PM] Nikhilsai Karnati: Yes sir

Such inhibition prevents the degradation of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). This results in improved glycaemic control as determined by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, and, in addition, an enhancement of pancreatic α- and β-cell function.</span></p><p><span>[14/09/23, 4:50:01 PM] Medha 2k19: Therapeutic Efficacy</span></p><p><span>In well designed monotherapy trials of 24–108 weeks’ duration (n = 131–786), vildagliptin provided effective glycaemic control as assessed by the change from baseline in HbA1c and FPG levels relative to placebo. Vildagliptin was as effective as acarbose and rosiglitazone, but not metformin, in terms of lowering HbA1c when noninferiority criteria were met. A pooled analysis of data from five monotherapy trials (n = 1138) further confirmed that vildagliptin provided effective glycaemic control after 24 weeks of treatment.</span></p><p><span>In combination therapy trials of 24 weeks’ duration in patients with type 2 diabetes for whom hyperglycaemia was inadequately controlled with prior metformin monotherapy, vildagliptin used as an adjunct to metformin provided better glycaemic control than placebo plus metformin (n = 416) and was as effective as pioglitazone plus metformin (n = 510) in improving glycaemic control in a noninferiority trial.</span></p><p><span>In other combination therapy studies also of 24 weeks’ duration (n = 296–408), vildagliptin was more effective than placebo as add-on therapy to insulin, glimepiride or pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by monotherapy despite receiving maximum effective doses</span></p><p><span>[14/09/23, 4:51:33 PM] Rakesh Biswas Sir Hod Med: Tell us more detail about the glucose numbers in the vildagliptin and placebo group and metformin group</span></p><p><span>[14/09/23, 4:53:03 PM] Medha 2k19: Sir, it seems that the images weren’t taken.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But, they asked for a review with full bladder, so we can get pictures then</span></p><p><span>[14/09/23, 6:32:37 PM] Medha 2k19: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6323540_Comparison_between_vildagliptin_and_metformin_to_sustain_reductions_in_HbA_1c_over_1year_in_drug-nave_patients_with_Type2_diabetes</span></p><p><span>[14/09/23, 6:34:26 PM] Medha 2k19: “At the study end, significant HbA(1c) reductions from baseline were seen with both vildagliptin (-1.0 +/- 0.1%, P &lt; 0.001) and metformin (-1.4 +/- 0.1%, P &lt; 0.001); however, statistical non-inferiority of 50 mg vildagliptin twice daily to 1000 mg metformin twice daily was not established”</span></p><p><span>[14/09/23, 6:34:45 PM] Medha 2k19: “A clinically meaningful decrease in HbA(1c) that was sustained throughout a 1-year treatment in drug-naïve patients with Type 2 DM was seen with both metformin and vildagliptin monotherapy.”</span></p><p><span>[14/09/23, 6:35:50 PM] Medha 2k19: “The incidence of hypoglycaemia was similarly low in both groups (&lt; 1%).”</span></p><p><span>CASE 4 :-&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>PaJR grp&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/GQcbsMAV3m4Lvwh03eVKBd">https://chat.whatsapp.com/GQcbsMAV3m4Lvwh03eVKBd</a></span></p><p><span>Blog :-&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><a href="https://nikhilsaikarnatirollno69.blogspot.com/2023/09/a-71-year-old-male-with-complaints-of.html">https://nikhilsaikarnatirollno69.blogspot.com/2023/09/a-71-year-old-male-with-complaints-of.html</a></span></p><p><span>A 71 year old male with complaints of loss of consciousness 30 mins back .

However, there is little evidence on patient-level benign outcomes to support the practice.</span></p><p><span>Methods</span></p><p><span>We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy and safety of oral sodium bicarbonate in CKD patients. A total of 1853 patients with chronic metabolic acidosis or those with low-normal serum bicarbonate (22–24 mEq/L) were performed to compare the efficacy and safety of oral sodium bicarbonate in patients with CKD.</span></p><p><span>Results</span></p><p><span>There was a significant increase in serum bicarbonate level (MD 2.37 mEq/L; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.72) and slowed the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (MD −4.44 mL/min per 1.73 m2, 95% CI, −4.92 to −3.96) compared with the control groups. The sodium bicarbonate lowered T50-time, an indicator of vascular calcification (MD −20.74 min; 95% CI, −49.55 to 8.08); however, there was no significant difference between the two groups. In addition, oral sodium bicarbonate dramatically reduced systolic blood pressure (MD −2.97 mmHg; 95% CI, −5.04 to −0.90) and diastolic blood pressure (MD −1.26 mmHg; 95% CI, −2.33 to −0.19). There were no statistically significant body weight, urine pH and mean mid-arm muscle circumference.</span></p><p><span>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8665881/</span></p><p><span>[15/08/23, 11:26:27 AM] Nikhilsai Karnati: Efficacy of NODOSIS Sir</span></p><p><span>[15/08/23, 11:26:43 AM] Nikhilsai Karnati: Trypsin:Chymotrypsin in Accidental, Surgical, and Orthopedic Injuries—Clinical Appraisal Goel and Sengupta [15] studied the efficacy of trypsin:chymotrypsin (Chymoral) in accidental soft tissue injuries. They included 156 patients (age between 14 and 45&nbsp;years) presenting in the casualty department with bruises, lacerations, hematomas, and sprains and strains. The patients were randomized into two groups: the Chymoral group (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), which received trypsin:chymotrypsin therapy along with standard emergency treatment, and the control group (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;77), which received emergency treatment only. The recommended dosage of Chymoral was employed, i.e., 2 tablets 4 times a day&nbsp;×&nbsp;7&nbsp;days, 30&nbsp;min before a meal. The patients were followed either once weekly or twice weekly and their progress was documented. Trypsin:chymotrypsin use resolves bruises within 8–12&nbsp;days, which otherwise cleared in 10–15&nbsp;days. In patients with lacerations, it improved the appearance of scarring due to stitches. Also, hematomas of the forehead and knees, which usually take 2–3&nbsp;weeks to clear, resolved within 10–12&nbsp;days in the Chymoral group. Ankle sprains normally take 2–3&nbsp;weeks to recover. However, speedy recovery was documented with trypsin:chymotrypsin use, clearing as quickly as within 7–12&nbsp;days. Additional benefits associated with the use of the enzyme preparation included relief in pain and lower incidence of infection. It was concluded that trypsin:chymotrypsin treatment in patients with accidental soft tissue injuries hastens the healing process and significantly reduces the recovery time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5778189/</span></p><p><span>[15/08/23, 11:29:04 AM] Nikhilsai Karnati: Sir ,therefore&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>it is concluded that chymotrypsin ( chymoral forte) treatment is significantly better tolerated and more effective than other enzyme preparations in resolving symptoms of inflammation and therefore promotes better healing.</span></p><p><span>[15/08/23, 1:16:32 PM] Rakesh Biswas Sir Hod Med: Share some of the RCTs from this review one by one in a PICO format to understand how the individual studies are much smaller than the summative systematic review that possibly pools apples and oranges.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Even if you look at the numbers that you shared you will realize they are not at all clinically significant inspite of the author's rhetoric!</span></p><p><span>[15/08/23, 1:38:11 PM] Nikhilsai Karnati: oral bicarbonate( nodosis)&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>is widely used to correct acidosis in advanced CKD,&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>this is not underpinned by any trial evidence,&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>real uncertainty exists regarding the balance of benefit and risk for this intervention.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As most patients with CKD are old, and many are frail, it is critical that trials testing such interventions enrol typical patients and use outcome measures that are relevant to older people.

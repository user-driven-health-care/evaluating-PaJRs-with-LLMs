The goal is to achieve an activated partial thromboplastin time of 50 to 70 seconds.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11382373/#:~:text=When%20intravenous%20heparin%20is%20administered,of%2050%20to%2070%20seconds.2)AMINOPHYLLINE:- May be used in cases of Pulmonary edema andpulmonary congestion secondary to heart failure.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/837650/3) INJ HAI according to Grbs 4) N ACETYLCYSTEINE:- NAC can effectively inhibit myocardial cell apoptosis caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and improve cardiac function.https://www.hindawi.com/journals/dm/2021/3625662/#5) MET XL FOR HIGH BP DE NOVO HYPERTENSION. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3952407/6) SYP LACTULOSE As the patient did not pass stools for 3 days from admission 7) SYP POTKLOR - as potassium levels decreased to 3.2. 8) LASIX:- furosemide to treat conditions with volume overload and edema secondary to congestive heart failure exacerbation.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499921/MY LEARNING POINTS:- I learned to integrate multiple systems to help a patient COPD; Heart failurehttps://www.respiratorylondon.co.uk/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-previously-known-as-emphysema-and-chronic-bronchitis/Heart failure:- https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) of the patient's case:Strengths:He has a supportive family who provides financial stability and assistance.He can sleep better with the use of medication.He is on good attender care.Weaknesses:1. The patient experiences severe shortness of breath 2. He was unable to tolerate BiPAP 3. The patient has been unable to find relief even on continuous medication 4. He has been experiencing sleep disturbances.5. The patient's condition may deteriorate Opportunities:1. Further evaluation and cardiologist/pulmonologist referral provide an opportunity for a comprehensive assessment and management of her condition.Threats:      1. The patient's dependence on medication and BIPAP may deteriorate to go into to ventilator.      2. There is more chance of death in the patient.      3. As he is hospitalised he may develop bed sores.      4. Exacerbation of the condition may be seen near future.

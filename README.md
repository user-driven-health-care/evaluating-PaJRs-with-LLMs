# Evaluating PaJRs with LLMs

This project aims to facilitate self reflection and self learning for PG medical students using evaluation of PaJRs using LLMs. 

There are two guides here - 
1. A visual quickstart guide that walks you through the steps of signing up with ChatGPT and evaluating your own PaJRs. [Visual Quickstart](https://github.com/user-driven-health-care/evaluating-PaJRs-with-LLMs/blob/main/docs/eval_PaJRs_LLMs_quickstart.md)
2. A detailed guide on how to build mastery over LLMs when using them in the medical context. [Detailed guide](https://github.com/user-driven-health-care/evaluating-PaJRs-with-LLMs/blob/main/docs/eval_PaJRs_LLMs_detailed_guide.md)
